# GCP-Localization
This project detects the GCP (Ground control Points) in an image dataset. My task was to research, formulate and implement a program to detect the GCPs within an image.

**Codes for detecting and locating GCP(Ground control Points) in images and storing data in .csv file**

**Requirements:**
* Python2+
* Numpy 1.5+
* OpenCV 


Download template image in same folder as the codes and image dataset

Codes have been tested on CV-Assignment-Dataset and ML - Dataset #2.

**Run the python code with**
python filename.py

* Results uploaded are from few images of CV-Assignment-Dataset

* SingleGCP-Template matching gives perfect result to detect best GCP in an image

* MultipleGCP-template matching has less accuracy, detects either all GCP's in an image or none
 
* Feature-Matching has been partially performed, due to few errors, some useful part has been commmented
